### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I am Aku Sarma


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on none.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nothing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on none.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with none.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Almost everything powered with electricity needs to be coded. Can you imagine?!

NOTE: Top languages does not indicate my skill level or something like that, it's a github calculation of which languages I have the most code on github.
